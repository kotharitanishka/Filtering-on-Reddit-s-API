# Filtering-on-Reddit's-API
- Flask is utilized as the backend framework, while NextJS and Tailwind CSS serve as the frontend components.
- Flask is responsible for data cleaning and creating three APIs: Hot, New, and Top posts.
- The API selectively includes only the author and image URL, filtering out irrelevant fields.
- NextJS communicates with these APIs and presents the results in a simplified manner using Tailwind CSS.
- Additional features implemented:
   1. Introduced the ability to retrieve hot and top posts.
   2. Incorporated key-based authentication.
   3. Excluded videos and other unnecessary fields.
